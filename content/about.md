## About me

Hello! My name is Lucie, but you can call me Luc.

I go by [they/them](https://pronoun.is/they) pronouns, while talking Spanish, I use **only** femenine pronouns (ella).

I am a developer from Argentina.

## Hobbies: Programming

I learned programming by myself, I find it enjoyable to create programs or scripts that solves problems.
I work as a fullstack software developer at a known international company.

My tech skills include but are not limited to: JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, Go, Python, Lua, Docker, SQL.

## Hobbies: General

Apart from programming I enjoy gaming, going out for a walk, working
out, watching cartoons (such as My Little Pony), anime (such as Yu-Gi-Oh!) or tv shows (such as The Mentalist), and generally enjoying my time with my partner, I am also part of the [furry fandom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furry_fandom).

## Life views

I have my own definition of nihilism, I try to re-think how I interact with everything
and find my own conclusions about them.

I identify as gender non-binary, as I dont associate with either cultural masculiny or
femininity, I enjoy creating my own meaning of gender expression. I fully support LGBTQIA+.

I believe everyone should treat each other respectfully regardless of gender, and that they should show their own interests instead of what society tells them to do.

I believe that all software should be [free as in freedom](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html). Dispite this, I live in a world where I have to interact with propietary software and I do not refuse to it, I just do not prefeer it.

My politics reside somewhere in the left side, I think capitalism has gone too far and might be taking us away from what it is important in life.

Make love, not war.
