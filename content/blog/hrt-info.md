I want to make this post to make this information more visible.

As you might know, a lot of people from the LGBTQIA+ collective might want to seek hormonal replacement therapy,
there are formal ways of doing this which are the most reccomended (accompanied by a Doctor or medical specialist).

And there are other people that might want to do them themselves, due to other reasons.

## How I created my mirror

I forked [diyhrt2.github.io](https://github.com/diyhrt2/diyhrt2.github.io) git repo, and replaced any fancy URL path with simple file names to make it simpler to host.

You can see [my own fork here](https://git.lucdev.net/luc/diyhrt).

Hosting was as simple as anything static, spin up a subdomain, a static server, configure the reverse proxy and good to go!

A cool project for the future might be to find a way to mirror the other sites as well, and make it automatic!

Stay safe everyone ‚ù§Ô∏èüß°üíõüíöüíôüíú
