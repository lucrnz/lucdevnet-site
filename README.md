# lucsite

Hey! This is my [website](https://lucdev.net) source code.
Currently, it is an [static generated site](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/static-site-generator/).

## Notes

Currently I think I hit the limit of my understanding of Zola, I have a lot of ideas for the site but I can't implement them because of the limitations of the template engine.

I plan to move this project to  in the future, I think it will be a better fit for my needs.

## Tools used

- [Astro](https://astro.build/) - static website generator
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/) - JavaScript runtime and package manager.

## Development

This will prepare all the resources and start a local server.

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

## Deployment

TBD.

## Disclaimer

I released the source code for transparency and to help other people create similar websites.
