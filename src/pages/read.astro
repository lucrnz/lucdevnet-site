      This article is about how Goole does its indexing in the current era of artifical Intelligence content.
      I heavily reccomend reading it since it is great for those who need to rank their content in this search engine.

    <ReadCard date={new Date("2024-04-19T00:00:00Z")} title="Redis is forked" url="https://newsletter.vickiboykis.com/archive/redis-is-forked/">
      Article about the forking of redis because it turned propietary software.
      My opinion: It seems that the project Valkey is more focused on improving the project while redic has a more "free software philosophy" approach.
      I advice to do your own research before migrating to an alternative if you need to.

      url="https://bun.sh/blog/bun-v1.0"
    >
      Bun is a JavaScript (and TypeScript) runtime, bundler, test runner and package manager.
      A complete alternative to Node, NPM, ESBuild, Webpack and other tools.
      The amazing performance it has means a lot for me.
  
      I am super excited for this release, I want this tool to success and become the new standard.
  
      If you are used to Node and npm please check it out, it will blow your mind!

    >
      Excellent read that talks about the experiences of JavaScript developers
      that try to support both ES-modules and CommonJS at the same time.
      
      I really hope we can transition to only ES-modules soon.

    >
    I love SQLite, I think it is a great database, but I always been told that
    "you don't go to production" with it. Now seeing it becoming "a great option for the Edge"
    where people are aiming to deploy right now, it is surreal for me.
    I am very happy for the team that worked on it, and I hope that people can find more use cases for it!.

      url="https://matklad.github.io/2023/02/12/a-love-letter-to-deno.html"
    >
      Deno is a fantastic tool that gives new breath to the JavaScript ecosystem,
      I like how you can just download one binary and start using it, no need to
      install Node.js or any other package manager. However, I still need to learn
      how to properly setup a full project with just Deno. Right now, I use it for
      small scripts and tools.

      In this long article, the author goes through xer experience with
      cryptocurrencies and NFT. I must admit I have been a user of this
      technology, and it saddens me the amount of scams that are around it,
      transaction fees, third-parties and required KYC verifications. Overall, I
      enjoyed this article, I recommend reading it while taking breaks.
