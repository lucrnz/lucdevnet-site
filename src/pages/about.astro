  <h2>About me</h2>

  <p>
    Hello! My name is Lucie, but you can call me Luc. I am a developer from
    Argentina, currently looking to relocate.
  </p>

  <p>
    I prefer
    <Link name="They/them" url="https://pronouns.within.lgbt/they" /> pronouns.
  </p>

  <h2>Hobbies: Programming</h2>

  <p>
    I learned programming by myself, I find it enjoyable to create programs or
    scripts that solves problems. I work as a fullstack software developer at a
    known international company. My tech skills include but are not limited to:
    JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, Go, Python, Lua, Docker, SQL.
  </p>

  <h2>Hobbies: General</h2>

  <p>
    Apart from programming I enjoy playing video games, going out for a walk,
    working out, watching cartoons (such as My Little Pony), anime (such as
    Yu-Gi-Oh!) or tv shows (such as The Mentalist), and generally enjoying my
    time with my partner, I am also part of the

      url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furry_fandom"
    />
  </p>

  <h2>Life views</h2>

  <p>
    I have my own definition of nihilism, I try to re-think how I interact with
    everything and find my own conclusions about them.
  </p>

  <p>
    I identify as gender non-binary, as I dont associate with either cultural
    masculiny or femininity, I enjoy creating my own meaning of gender
    expression. I fully support LGBTQIA+.
  </p>

  <p>
    I believe everyone should treat each other respectfully regardless of
    gender, and that they should show their own interests instead of what
    society tells them to do; helping each other and trying to make the world a
    better place.
  </p>

  <p>
    I use tools to fit my needs and get stuff done, I tend to prefer <Link

      url="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html"
    /> software if possible.
  </p>

  <p>Make love, not war.</p>
